          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Keller and I am the founder of Distant Lands. My journey
            into entrepreneurship began in 2018, fueled by a lifelong love for
            video game development. I've been immersed in creating games since I
            was a kid, and that passion led me to specialize in Unity
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Distant Lands isn't just about crafting captivating games; it's also
            about sharing my expertise and supporting budding developers. I've
            always had a fervor for helping newcomers in the field. My goal is
            to provide the necessary tools and resources to kickstart their
            projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, Distant Lands is more than a business; it's a commitment to
            nurturing a community of aspiring developers. I aim to foster a
            space where innovation thrives, and individuals are empowered to
            create and collaborate. My vision is to inspire others and create a
            platform where creativity flourishes alongside a shared enthusiasm
            for game development.

                Under the title of Distant Lands, I create extensions, art,
                utilities, and shaders for game developers to use in their
                projects. In essence I build the Lego bricks that game
                developers use to create their games.
              </p>
              <p>
                I function as a solo contracted developer and have had my hand
                in countless games over the 5 years I have operated the company.
